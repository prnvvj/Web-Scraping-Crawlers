# Web Scraping
Web Scraping is getting more and more important in the current days. I will go out on a limb here, and assume you have already heard the expression **“Data is the new oil”**. If I define web scraping as **the ability to quickly gather all sorts of data from virtually any website**, it should not be difficult to understand why there are so many businesses investing in the Web Scraping specially in their nascent stage.
### The web scraping triad
In this repository I've focused on three different Python libraries that are more than enough for getting almost available data on the world wide web.
-   _**Beautiful Soup**_
-   _**Selenium**_
-   _**Scrapy**_ </br>
I will go over their main features and limitations, and provide a few examples of when to use one or another.
